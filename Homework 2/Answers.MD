1. a) yes, [1 9 25 49 81 121 169 225 289] seems to be in the same equivalence class
   b) this is divided between 4 and 0 classes in a way such that no adjacent squares would be in the same class
2. 
O(n) - with the input size the output complexity increases linearly
O(1) - with the input size output complexity does not change, constant time
O(log(n)) - with the input size output complexity increases logarithmically which is better than O(n) worse than O(1)

O(1) which has the constant time. 
which will not grow with the input size because when the proof is big it is difficult when it comes to the verification process and might affect the time complexities of proof verification which we would like to keep it a minimum compared to proof generation process.
